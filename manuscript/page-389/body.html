It bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home.</p><p>Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her shoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands were always clean. She was not beautiful,—she was common, and could not be like Estella,—but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.</p></div> </div>
