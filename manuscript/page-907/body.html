She might have been some two or three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed of portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both before and behind, made her figure very like a boyâ€™s kite; and I might have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves a little too intensely green.</p></div> </div>
