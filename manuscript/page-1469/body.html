He knows it, Joseph, as none can. You do not know it, Joseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.’”</p><p>Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face to talk thus to mine.</p><p>“Says you, ‘Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now repeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of Providence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it plain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. Reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun’s. But that man said he did not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all.
