At first, a misgiving crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.</p><p>“What’s all this?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You with an old father, and you with pleasant and playful ways?”</p><p>“Well!” returned Wemmick. “If I don’t bring ‘em here, what does it matter?”</p></div> </div>
