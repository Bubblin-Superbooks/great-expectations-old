The bread and meat were acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon in spirits to look about me.</p><p>To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it.</p></div> </div>
