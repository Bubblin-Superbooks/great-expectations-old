Then he looked at me, and said, correcting himself,—</p><p>“To be sure! Yes. You’re in the habit of shaking hands?”</p><p>I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion, but said yes.</p><p>“I have got so out of it!” said Mr. Wemmick,—“except at last. Very glad, I’m sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!”</p><p>When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window’s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully looking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.</p></div> </div>
