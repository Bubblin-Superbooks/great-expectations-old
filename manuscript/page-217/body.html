(I beg to observe that I think of myself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)</p><p>“Flags!” echoed my sister.</p><p>“Yes,” said I. “Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out at the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.”</p><p>“Swords!” repeated my sister. “Where did you get swords from?”</p><p>“Out of a cupboard,” said I. “And I saw pistols in it,—and jam,—and pills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up with candles.”</p></div> </div>
