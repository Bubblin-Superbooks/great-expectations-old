<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.</p><p>“Oh! Don’t cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror. “Pray don’t do it, sir.”</p><p>“Tell us your name!” said the man. “Quick!”</p><p>“Pip, sir.”</p></div> </div>
