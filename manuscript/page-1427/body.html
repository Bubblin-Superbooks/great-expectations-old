Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I opened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the bedside, Joe. I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the window-seat, smoking his pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw Joe. I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was Joeâ€™s. I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.</p></div> </div>
