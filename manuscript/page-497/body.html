I was better after I had cried than before,â€”more sorry, more aware of my own ingratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe with me then.</p><p>So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another evening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made up my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back, when we changed again.</p></div> </div>
