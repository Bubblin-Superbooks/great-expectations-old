I went all round it; round by the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the paths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary all!</p><p>Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it, and walked through.</p></div> </div>
