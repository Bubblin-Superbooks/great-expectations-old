<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said, “If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.”</p><p>“Speak to your master?” said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused again. “How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or speak to me—at some other time.”</p><p>“Begging your pardon, ma’am,” returned the housemaid, “I should wish to speak at once, and to speak to master.”</p><p>Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of ourselves until he came back.</p></div> </div>
