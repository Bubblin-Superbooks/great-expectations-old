Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures.</p><p>“They are mounting up, Handel,” Herbert would say; “upon my life, they are mounting up.”</p><p>“Be firm, Herbert,” I would retort, plying my own pen with great assiduity. “Look the thing in the face.
