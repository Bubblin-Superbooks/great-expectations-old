<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,â€”a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.</p><p>My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this apron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken it off, every day of her life.</p></div> </div>
