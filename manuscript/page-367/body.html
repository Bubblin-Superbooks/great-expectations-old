We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.</p><p>“Halloa!” we said, stopping. “Orlick there?”</p><p>“Ah!” he answered, slouching out. “I was standing by a minute, on the chance of company.”</p><p>“You are late,” I remarked.</p><p>Orlick not unnaturally answered, “Well? And you’re late.”</p></div> </div>
