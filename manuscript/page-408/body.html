<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and get over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate, or from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant way), Old Orlick.</p><p>“Halloa!” he growled, “where are you two going?”</p><p>“Where should we be going, but home?”</p><p>“Well, then,” said he, “I’m jiggered if I don’t see you home!”</p><p>This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of his. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger, I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.</p></div> </div>
