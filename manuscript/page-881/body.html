<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread. “Biddy,” said I, when I gave her my hand at parting, “I am not angry, but I am hurt.”</p><p>“No, don’t be hurt,” she pleaded quite pathetically; “let only me be hurt, if I have been ungenerous.”</p><p>Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to me, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy was quite right, all I can say is,—they were quite right too.</p></div> </div>
